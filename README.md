# Chat with Multiple PDFs

This project is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to interact with multiple PDF documents. Utilizing FAISS for efficient document retrieval and a T5 model for generating responses, this application processes PDF documents, splits the text into manageable chunks, vectorizes the text, and stores it in a FAISS index. Users can then ask questions, and the system retrieves relevant document sections to generate responses.
